Description: custom secured DNS query wrapper
 DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client 
 and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures 
 to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and
 haven't been tampered with.
 .
 This package provides server-side proxy for DNS queries to a designated
 upstream.
